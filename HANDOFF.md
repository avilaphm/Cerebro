Refined premium client dashboard UX and booking calendar.

## Last commit
refine premium client dashboard ux

## Current state

Dashboard and client portal use the liquid glass design direction from the Claude Design handoff bundle, with the client portal refined toward a lighter premium coaching cockpit.

Shipped in this session:
- Installed two UI/UX Codex skills from GitHub for future sessions: `ui-design` and `ui-ux-design-pro`. Restart Codex before relying on them as named skills.
- Fixed the client portal scroll shell by using a stable viewport-height app container, an internal scroll pane, and extra bottom padding above the floating nav.
- Raised the client footer nav off the bottom safe area and moved the client message bubble to the top right.
- Increased client portal form/control readability and softened rounded control styling within the dashboard skin.
- Reworked the Tools booking calendar into day, week, and month views. Day/week show available, busy, and own booked slots; month only shows booked days.
- Added calendar-driven cancellation: clicking an owned booking opens cancellation, and late cancellations prompt for a reason before sending Pedro an approval request.
- Moved Body Metrics from Overview to Tools, moved the progress summary from Overview to Workout, and placed the next session at the top of Tools.
- Replaced the loud green completed-workout card treatment with a subtle under-card glow and restrained black check state.
- Downloaded and read the Claude Design bundle from `https://api.anthropic.com/v1/design/h/oZbR-OuOAm6vkIqUehlDQA`, including README, transcript, and the admin/client HTML prototypes.
- Added a scoped liquid glass system in `app/globals.css` for `/dashboard` and `/client` surfaces only.
- Updated the main dashboard layout/sidebar to use a floating dark glass sidebar, warm monochrome background, translucent panels, rounded controls, and soft inner highlights.
- Updated the PT dashboard shell/nav to inherit the same glass system while preserving the nested PT navigation structure.
- Updated the client portal root and bottom nav to match the glass direction without affecting public marketing pages.
- Added `session_duration_minutes` and `buffer_minutes` to PT booking availability. Defaults are 45 minute sessions and 5 minute buffers.
- Booking blocks now reserve the session plus buffer, while appointments and Google Calendar events stay at the true 45 minute session time.
- Client `/client` Tools tab now shows a calendar-style booking widget with available, busy, and own-booking states.
- Pedro `/dashboard/pt/bookings` now shows a coach calendar with client names, booking status, and quick complete/cancel controls.
- Client booking rules are server-side: 48 hours minimum notice, 28 day horizon, recurring bookings inside the horizon, credit holds for future bookings, cancellation request inside 24 hours.
- Friday morning booking reminder automation is scheduled in Supabase Cron through `manage-pt-booking` action `send_weekly_reminders`.
- Google Calendar sync on booking create/cancel now fails soft and preserves the booking flow if the external sync endpoint or Google API is down.

Recent shipped surfaces include:
- `/dashboard/bookings` internal booking cockpit backed by Supabase booking tables.
- `/dashboard/leads` lead pipeline and tag-based stage tracking.
- `/dashboard/pt` PT dashboard, client portal, programme, messaging, coaching, and review workflows.
- Public marketing routes including `/`, `/finance`, `/operators`, `/blog`, `/privacy`, and `/terms`.
- No outstanding tracked phases remain in the repo right now.

## Clean Slate Rules
- There are no active saved phase lists.
- There are no active saved todo lists.
- Do not infer next work from deleted plans.
- For new work, use Pedro's current brief.

## Known Notes
- Do not run `supabase db push`. Remote migration history is ahead of local. Use `supabase db query` or MCP migration paths.
- Full repo lint has pre-existing failures outside recent work. Prefer targeted build/type verification.
- Pre-commit hook rejects em dashes in markdown files. Use plain hyphens.
- Supabase Cron job `pt-booking-weekly-reminders` is active on project `otcnrkfvgyvwolironoz` with schedule `0 22 * * 4`, which maps to Friday morning Sydney time in the current timezone.
- Google Calendar sync is wired in `manage-pt-booking` through `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_SYNC_URL` or `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ACCESS_TOKEN` plus `GOOGLE_CALENDAR_ID`. No Google secret was present locally, so calendar writes will no-op until one of those secrets is configured.
- Resend email sending uses existing `RESEND_API_KEY` and `RESEND_FROM_PEDRO_NOTIFY` Edge Function secrets when available.
- Security advisor still reports `pg_net` installed in `public` from the live project. Attempting `ALTER EXTENSION pg_net SET SCHEMA extensions` is not supported by the extension, so this was left as an existing non-blocking warning rather than dropping/recreating the extension on a live project.
